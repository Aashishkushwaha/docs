It is a technique using which we can test individual to determine if there are any issues present in the developed module. It is concerned with functional correctness of the standalone modules.

The main focus is to isolate each unit of the system to identify, analyze and fix the defects to improve the quality of the developed module.

## Unit Testing Techniques

Below are some of the different techniques used in unit testing:

- **Black Box Testing** - In this unit testing type, the unit testers are not aware of the internal functionality of the system and are allowed for testing the structure of the function, i.e. the user interface, input, and output.

- **White Box Testing** - It is also known as `transparent` testing or `glass box` testing. In this unit testing type, the functional behavior of the software is tested by the developers in order to validate their execution.

- **Gray Box Testing** - It is the combination of both black-box and white-box testing. In this method, the tester is partially aware of the system functionality and uses this approach for testing various test methods, for executing test suites, and to perform the risk assessment. Also, this unit testing type is known as `semi-transparent` testing.

## Who performs Unit Testing?

The unit test cases are written and executed by software developers. But, in some exceptional cases where developers take a back off to this process, this `white-box` testing technique is performed by QA engineers.

## Advantages of Unit Testing

- It minimizes the defects in the newly developed features or reduces bugs when changing the existing functionality.
- It helps in identifying and fixing the bugs at the early stage
- It helps the developers to improve the design by allowing refactoring of the code
- Unit tests, when integrated with build, it improves the quality of the build as well.
